# MTCNN-Leaf
An experiment to re-purpose MTCNN for other uses than facial detection
This repo is the source code for implementing MTCNN using Caffe.

# Introduction
This was the first half of my Thesis project.
The goal is to re-purpose the MTCNN Facial detection model 
and use it on an ESP-32 AI-Thinker WiFi Camera module.
--> That code is in another repository

# MTCNN

# SETUP
You'll need caffe installed, and setup can be done in the same way as 

https://github.com/lincolnhard/mtcnn-head-detection

There are a few Data preprocessing python scripts I also made to
help clean out the datasets I used. They are included at the top level directory.

There is also a python script that extracts the weights from a Caffe model and forms them into a numpy array file. This is used to translate the weights from one framework (caffe) to another (ESP-Face) The translation code is included in the ESP32-Leaf repository because it is a specific translation for that framework.


# Output
--> could use some improvement, but overall it found some leaves
